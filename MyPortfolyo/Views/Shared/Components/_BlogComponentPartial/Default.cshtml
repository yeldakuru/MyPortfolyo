					<p>
						With ASP.NET Core, the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture provides a powerful way to structure web applications. MVC clearly separates the data (Model), user interface (View), and business logic (Controller) layers of the application, making the code more organized and maintainable. ASP.NET Core is a lightweight framework that offers high performance and flexibility, allowing modern web applications to be developed in line with the MVC structure. This structure makes it easier for developers to write reusable and testable code. In addition, ASP.NET Core’s platform independence allows applications to run smoothly on different operating systems.

                    <p>
                        Multi-tiered architecture is a software architecture that separates business logic, data access, and user interface into layers in web applications using C# and .NET Core. This architecture allows each layer to be developed, tested, and scaled independently. The business logic layer manages the core operations of the application, while the data access layer handles database operations and the presentation layer provides the user interface. This approach increases maintainability of the code and provides better organization in large-scale projects.

                    <p>
                        Blazor is a modern framework developed by Microsoft that allows you to create web applications using C#. It allows you to develop interactive and dynamic user interfaces using C# instead of JavaScript. Blazor offers two different models that can work on both the server side (Blazor Server) and the client side (Blazor WebAssembly), so developers can create flexible solutions according to the needs of the application. This framework integrates with a full .NET ecosystem, allowing code to be reused on both the server and the client side. Blazor simplifies web development processes and offers developers with C# knowledge a faster and more efficient way.

                    <p>
                        Dart and Flutter are modern mobile and web application development tools developed by Google. Dart is an easy-to-learn and fast-working programming language, designed specifically to work with the Flutter framework. Flutter, on the other hand, allows you to develop high-performance, beautiful-looking applications for both Android and iOS with a single codebase. In addition, thanks to the "hot reload" feature, developers can see code changes instantly and quickly develop their applications iteratively. Dart and Flutter offer a powerful combination that accelerates cross-platform application development and makes the development process enjoyable.
